    description: |
      This model tracks the warehouse size and name over time. It contains 1 row per period that the warehouse state applies. The following caveats apply:

      - if user changes the warehouse size/name, we won't register the new attributes until the next query runs against it
      - this could also mean that warehouse size changes are not registered if they were changed and then reverted

      - name: warehouse_size
        description: The size of the warehouse during the given period
