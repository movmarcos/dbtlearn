## dbt-snowflake-monitoring 3.0.0 - February 26, 2023
After attempting to use only query comments or query tags in versions 1 and 2, we've learned we actually need both. The reasons for that are:
* The `is_incremental` macro is only available from within the query tag dbt context, and is needed to determine whether a model run is incremental or not.
* Query tags have a maximum character limit of 2000, which is easily exceeded by a list of refs containing more than a few models.

To upgrade from 2.x.x, follow the latest instructions in the [Quickstart](https://github.com/get-select/dbt-snowflake-monitoring#quickstart). The package is still able to process query metadata generated by previous versions of the package, so no data will be lost on upgrade.

### Breaking Changes

- Use query comments and query tags to avoid query tag character limit ([#87](https://github.com/get-select/dbt-snowflake-monitoring/pull/87))
