## dbt-snowflake-monitoring 2.0.0 - February 08, 2023
The most significant change in 2.0.0 is using query tags instead of comments to attach dbt metadata to queries. To upgrade from previous versions:

1. Remove the query comment configuration from `dbt_project.yml`
2. Follow the instructions to configure the query tag in the [Quickstart](https://github.com/get-select/dbt-snowflake-monitoring#quickstart).

### Breaking Changes

- Switch to using query tags instead of comments ([#78](https://github.com/get-select/dbt-snowflake-monitoring/pull/78))
